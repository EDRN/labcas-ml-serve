# üß†¬†LabCAS ML Service Œ≤

This is the LabCAS Machine Learning Service, currently supporting Alphan Altinok's Nuclei Detection model.

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†Production Usage

The service is hosted at the following address: https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/. It is open to the public but requires an [EDRN username and password to access](https://www.compass.fhcrc.org/edrns/pub/user/application.aspx?t=app&sub=form1&w=1&p=3).

To submit an image and receive a task identifier, try a command like the following:

    curl --user 'USERNAME:PASSWORD' --request POST \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \
        --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
        --form 'input_image=@IMAGE_FILE_PATH;type=image/png' \
        'https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/alphan/predict?model_name=unet_default&is_extract_regionprops=True&window=128' 

Replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with your EDRN credentials. Replace `IMAGE_FILE_PATH` with the path to the image you want to upload. You will receive back a task identifier, which you use in the next step.

To get the results from your task, try a command like the following:

    curl --user 'USERNAME:PASSWORD' --request GET \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' --output output.zip \
        'https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/results/get_results?task_id=TASK_ID'

Replace `TASK_ID` with the task identifier you received from the earlier `curl` command.

Example client programs in the R and Python programming languages and a sample test image to process are provided in the `samples` directory.


## üõ†Ô∏è¬†Development and Local Use

To build and run the LabCAS ML Service locally, clone this `git` repository and run the following commands:

```console
$ docker image build --tag labcas-ml-serve .
$ env EDRN_IMAGE_OWNER= LABCAS_ARCHIVE_PATH=${PWD}/test_archive docker compose up
```

üëâ **Note:** On some systems, `docker compose` is `docker-compose`.

The following endpoints will be available:

-   http://localhost:8080/alphan/ ‚Äî ReST API for predicting and training the model
    -   http://localhost:8080/alphan/docs ‚Äî Interactive documentation where you can try out the ReST API
    -   https://localhost:9443/alphan/docs ‚Äî Same, but over https
-   http://localhost:8080/results/ ‚Äî ReST API for checking on task status or retrieving completed nuclei detection
    -   http://localhost:8080/results/docs ‚Äî Interactive documentation for the above
    -   https://localhost:9443/results/docs ‚Äî Same, but over https
-   http://localhost:8265/ ‚Äî Ray's Dashboard
-   gcs://localhost:6378/ ‚Äî Ray "Global Control Server" port

üëâ **Note:** The `https` endpoints use a self-signed certificate.

You can stop the composed processes by hitting your interrupt key (typically ‚åÉC). The `outputs` directory created in the host environment will contain model outputs should you need to diagnose issues.

Don't forget to remake the `labcas-ml-serve` image with `docker image build` as you make changes to the source code. You can launch the composition locally for development with:
```console
$ env EDRN_IMAGE_OWNER= LABCAS_ARCHIVE_PATH=${HOME} docker compose up
```


### üö¢¬†Publishing to the Docker Hub

Once you have a working system, tag it with a version number and publish it to the Docker Hub:

```console
$ docker image tag labcas-ml-serve nutjob4life/labcas-ml-serve:1.2.3
$ docker image push nutjob4life/labcas-ml-serve:1.2.3
```

### üå±¬†Environment Variables

The following table lists the environment variables used by the LabCAS ML Service's composition:

| Variable Name             | Use                                                       | Default                    |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| `EDRN_IMAGE_OWNER`        | Name of image owning org.; empty string for a local image | `nutjob4life/`             |
| `EDRN_ML_SERVE_VERSION`   | Version of the LabCAS ML Serve image to use               | `latest`                   |
| `PWD`                     | Current working directory for model `outputs`             | The current directory      |
| `EDRN_RAY_SERVE_PORT`     | GCS port for Ray Serve                                    | 6378                       |

## üöÄ¬†Deployment at JPL

First run

    /usr/bin/env EDRN_HTTP_PORT=9080 EDRN_ML_SERVE_VERSION=VERSION /usr/local/bin/docker-compose --file /usr/local/labcas/ml-serve/docker-compose.yaml

Replace `VERSION` with the version you want. Then, inform the system administrators to set up a reverse-proxy so that

    https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/ ‚Üí https://edrn-docker:9443/

This endpoint should be behind an HTTP Basic auth challenge that uses `ldaps://edrn-ds.jpl.nasa.gov/dc=edrn,dc=jpl,dc=nasa,dc=gov?uid?one?(objectClass=edrnPerson)` as the AuthLDAPURL

You can test for success by checking that these URLs:

-   https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/alphan/predict should return 405, method not allowed
-   https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/alphan/train should return 200 OK and the payload `null`
-   https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/results/get_results should return 422, unprocessable entity
-   https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/mlserve/results/task_status should also return 422, unprocessable entity
